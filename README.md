Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile!

I'm Jani, an IT student at Oulu University of Applied Sciences. My studies are nearing completion â€“ only the internship phase remains â€“ and I'm currently working toward my Bachelor of Engineering in Information Technology (expected graduation: 2027).

Before diving into tech, I spent over six years in manufacturing as an extrusion line operator. That experience gave me a practical mindset, strong problem-solving skills, and a hands-on approach that I now bring into software development.

On this profile, you'll find projects that reflect my journey in:

- Backend development (Node.js, Python, SQL)
- Web technologies (React, JavaScript)
- Automation and practical problem-solving

I'm especially interested in backend development and building things that actually solve real-world problems. I enjoy learning by doing, and Iâ€™m always curious to try new tools and technologies.

Thanks for stopping by â€” feel free to explore my repos or reach out if you want to connect!
