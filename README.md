Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile!

I am an IT student at Oulu University of Applied Sciences, currently pursuing a Bachelor of Engineering in Information Technology, with an expected graduation in 2027. My journey into tech follows six years of experience as an extrusion line operator, where I honed skills in problem-solving, efficiency, and teamwork.

Here, you'll find projects and code that showcase my learning and growth as a developer, with a focus on:

    Software Development
    Automation
    Backend and Frontend Technologies

I am passionate about blending technical skills with real-world problem-solving, and I look forward to exploring more in the world of programming and technology.

Feel free to explore my repositories, and donâ€™t hesitate to reach out if you'd like to collaborate or chat about coding!
